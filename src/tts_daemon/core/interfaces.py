"""Ports of the gateway: the interfaces that adapters implement.

To add a new TTS engine you implement :class:`TTSProvider` and register it
(see ``tts_daemon.providers.registry``); to add a new audio output you
implement :class:`AudioPlayer`. Nothing else in the gateway needs to change.

Both interfaces are deliberately synchronous. Providers are typically
subprocess or HTTP calls and players block for the duration of a clip; the
gateway runs them on worker threads so the API event loop is never blocked.
A synchronous contract keeps third-party implementations trivial to write
and test.
